when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if i want to share my work with others or i want to backup it for safety purposes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
inorder only to have commits that make sense rather than having too many commits
