when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
if i want to share my work with others or i want to backup it for safety purposes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
inorder only to have commits that make sense rather than having too many commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks: used to make a copy of another repository onto your account on github 
clones: used to make a copy of another repository onto your local disk
branches: to make changes in the repository it self if i want to make a new feature or make others share in my work without affecting mine

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
to help solve conflicts when merging branches

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
it would be easier when i work on my one with no conflicts but it would be harder if the project needs collaboration
